There are various ways of running ABS models.

## Use On-Line Tools

The simplest way to use the ABS tools is on-line, in the
collaboratory.  This means you only need a modern browser to start
experimenting with ABS.  The tools work best with Firefox and Chrome.

An introduction and link to the collaboratory can be found at
