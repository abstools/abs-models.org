# The ABS Language

ABS is a language for Abstract Behavioral Specification, which combines
implementation-level specifications with verifiability, high-level design with
executablity, and formal semantics with practical usability. ABS is a
concurrent, object-oriented, modeling language that features functional
data-types.

* ABS is designed to develop executable models with an object-oriented program
  flow
* ABS targets distributed and concurrent systems by means of concurrent object
  groups and asynchronous method calls
* ABS supports model variability based on delta-oriented specifications
* ABS supports deployment modelling based on high-level deployment models
* ABS supports a range of techniques for model exploration and analysis, based
  on formal semantics
